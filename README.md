# World ID Widget Module üÜî

A modern, secure decentralized identity verification application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. World ID Widget Module integrates Worldcoin's World ID protocol with Reown (formerly WalletConnect) to provide seamless wallet connections and privacy-preserving human verification for decentralized applications (dApps).

## Overview

World ID Widget Module demonstrates the integration of two powerful Web3 technologies:
- **World ID**: Worldcoin's privacy-preserving proof-of-personhood protocol
- **Reown AppKit**: Advanced wallet connection infrastructure for seamless dApp interactions

This application serves as a reference implementation for developers looking to build dApps that require both wallet connectivity and human verification, enabling use cases like sybil-resistant voting, fair airdrops, and authenticated user experiences.

## Features

- **World ID Integration**: Privacy-preserving human verification using Worldcoin's orb and phone verification methods
- **Secure Wallet Connections**: Connect to popular crypto wallets using Reown's advanced protocol  
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Support for Ethereum, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible networks through Wagmi
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI for managing both identity verification and wallet connections
- **Real-Time Verification**: Instant World ID verification with detailed result display
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React v19 with TypeScript and Next.js v15.3.3
- **Identity**: World ID (@worldcoin/idkit) for human verification
- **Wallet Integration**: Reown AppKit with Wagmi adapter for multi-wallet support
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state management
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Viem for Ethereum interactions
- **Styling**: CSS modules with responsive design
- **Development**: ESLint for code quality and TypeScript for type safety
